# cal
Recreation of the terminal program Cal, written in Ruby

#Objectives
Practice with Arrays, Hashes, and Strings
Develop the logic of a non-trivial algorithm
Programming to meet a (changing) specification

#Requirements
Your program must have tests. These test may be as high-level (integration tests) or as low-level (unit tests) as you wish. I highly recommend a mix of tests.
You may not use any of the built-in Ruby classes that provide date, time, or calendar functionality.

You may not use exec, Kernel, etc. to shell out to any Unix programs.
You should not use "magic" numbers.
You must commit your code at least once per day and push it to your github repository.

As a capstone project for the basic Ruby portion of the course, this should demonstrate your skills. Do not share code with your peers. You can help each other think about the problems, but don't help each other code.
Your program should accept any combination of months and years between 1800 and 3000.
